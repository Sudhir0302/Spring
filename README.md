1.IOC -> Inversion of control which is a container of objects of all classes.

2.Autowire -> autowiring in Spring, you donâ€™t need to manually create an object of one class to use in another. The Spring Framework takes care of creating, managing, and injecting the required objects (beans) into your classes.

3.DI -> Dependency Injection means to provide (injecting) other class objects in to a class using annotations such as @Bean, @Autowired ,etc.

4.@component -> an object is created in ioc when it is annotated by @component annotation.By default the object is singleton object(bean).

5.@Qualifier("bean_name") -> to specify which bean to use.(Note: if both qualifier and primary there means, qualifier gets the first preference)

6.@Primary -> to specify that is the first preferred bean
